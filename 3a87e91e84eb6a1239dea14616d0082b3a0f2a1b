      "message": "Minor functional change: previously, `--subject_is_intermediate_authority` was silently ignored if `--usage` was also specified. Now argparse will fail with a message about exclusive args if both are specified.\n\nIMO this is better anyway because it was undocumented and potentially confusing that `--subject_is_intermediate_authority` interacted with `--usage` in this way. But if this seems like a valid or useful behavior then we can go back to the previous approach.",
