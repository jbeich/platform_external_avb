So I would prefer to keep the existing implementation.\n\nIf it\u0027s not too difficult, I would also suggest we build two test libavb_host_unittest binaries, one with the existing implementation and one with BoringSSL.\n\nWe should then add both those binaries to a TEST_MAPPING file so both tests are run on presubmit (I thought we already had that actually).\n\nWhen getting around to adding curve 25519 support I think it would be fine to only add this to the BoringSSL-based implementation...",
