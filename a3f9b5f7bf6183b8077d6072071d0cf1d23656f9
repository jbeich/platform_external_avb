      "message": "I\u0027ve been making all the traits take `\u0026mut` up until now, if we just did a non-mutable reference here it might make it difficult for the user to implement, so I feel like we need to allow them to have `\u0026mut` for flexibility.\n\nFor example, `get_size_of_partition()` might mean reading the GPT from disk and checking the listed partition size. This action will require reading bits from disk into some mutable buffer. If `self` is immutable, then the implementation would have to somehow find a mutable buffer without affecting any of its own state.\n\nSince our code doesn\u0027t care whether we pass a mutable or immutable ref when calling these methods, it works either way for us, so IMO we might as well make this mutable and give the implementation more flexibility.",
