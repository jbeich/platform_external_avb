      "message": "I think the issue is not integer overflow, because desc_end is also 32 bit pointer, so `nb_total + p \u003e desc_end` would\u0027ve caught that.\n\nThe issue that triggered asan is casting \u0026p (const uint8**, 32 bit pointer to a 32 bit pointer) to uint64_t* (32 bit pointer to a uint64_t), and then in avb_safe_add_to it will write 4 bytes past the end of p to 0.\n\nI think simply changing it to `p +\u003d nb_total` should be enough since we already checked overflow at line 105.",
