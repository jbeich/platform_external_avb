      "message": "I had thought this would be useful to be able to selectively enable the Uuid feature, in particular for when this gets ported to out-of-tree bootloaders who may really want to minimize dependencies, but now I\u0027m not 100% convinced.\n\nIf we were using Cargo to build I think this would be easy since the end user can [select features for each dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#choosing-features) in their own `cargo.toml` file.\n\nBut as far as I can tell in Soong we need to pre-configure each build target with its own dependencies, which means we need separate targets for +uuid and -uuid (and it also scales horribly as we add more features).\n\nWDYT, should I just remove this feature selection and just force our users to depend on the uuid crate, or keep it optional?",
