      "message": "Actually AVB_ALIGNMENT_SIZE \u003d 8 does not work for our 32bit bootloader because the bootloader allocate buffer (via avb_alloc) which has  4byte alignment but avb_assert_word_aligned checks 8byte alignment. As result avb_assert is fired.\n\nNote: I added building 32bit version of libavb localy and use it in our bootloader.\n\nMore thoughts:\n - It is not good idea include avb_sysdeps.c by default, because a bootloader, for example, may not have everything. better to have libavb and libavb_posix versions of library\n - better to build both 64bit and 32bit versions, because a lot of bootloaders on devices are built in 32bit mode.\n - also there is a pain between clang and gcc compatibility and I do not know how to solve this. For now I just made local modification in Android.mk to build 32bit version of libavb using gcc instead of clang",
