      "message": "I believe so, I think you\u0027ll just need to ensure the panic_handler is defined for the dylib build.\n\nWe handle this in some of our other no_std crates by conditionally adding std for the dylib build with the `android_dylib` cfg flag. See `libm` as an example\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:external/rust/crates/libm/src/lib.rs;drc\u003d1219dfba4a9a98bff94ec295593b6a1a00ad420c;l\u003d15\n\nThere isn\u0027t a separate bug specifically for this, it was just blocking work related to that bug. I\u0027ll make a note to update relevant documentation though, and feel free to ping me directly as well.",
