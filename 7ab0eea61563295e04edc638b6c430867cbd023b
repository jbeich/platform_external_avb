As with read_from_partition() we allow partial I/O, e.g. |out_num_read| returned may be smaller than |num_bytes| passed in.\n\nAdditionally, to easier manage the life-time we should add a release_preloaded_partition() operation and guarantee that is called whenever the resulting AvbPartitionData is freed.",
