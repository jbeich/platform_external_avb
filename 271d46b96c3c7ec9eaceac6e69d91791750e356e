It looks to me like it\u0027s just writing it to the file given by --output.\n\nWas the plan all along to store the AvbIpcBlob at the end of the vbmeta image? I had a vague idea that it was going to be in another partition, it could be I remember it wrong.\n\nIt\u0027s also not clear to me _when_ the inclusion proof is checked or what the general flow is when the device is booting... I think documenting this in README.md (as requested in the previous comment ðŸ˜Š) would help a ton with having readers understand how everything fits together!",

      "message": "First part ack, will fix. \n\nThe plan was originally to store it in a separate partition, but after discussions, we decided that the additional overhead for OEMs to generate a new partition, especially a smaller one, was not optimal. It was suggested to us to store it at the end of the vbmeta partition in a way that would not interfere with the integrity of the vbmeta information. \n\nWill update the readme to include AFTL affected flow. :)",
