      "message": "Is this actually what \u0027make_icp_from_vbmeta\u0027 does, though? It looks to me like it\u0027s just writing it to the file given by --output.\n\nWas the plan all along to store the AvbIpcBlob at the end of the vbmeta image? I had a vague idea that it was going to be in another partition, it could be I remember it wrong.\n\nIt\u0027s also not clear to me _when_ the inclusion proof is checked or what the general flow is when the device is booting... I think documenting this in README.md (as requested in the previous comment ðŸ˜Š) would help a ton with having readers understand how everything fits together!",
